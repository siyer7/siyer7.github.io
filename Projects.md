## Cognitive processes underlying Collective Empathy (poster at <a href="https://socialaffectiveneuro.org">Social Affective Neuroscience Society, 2022</a>)  
**Overview** - Empathic subjects are those who seem to collectively & synchronously engage in mentalizing (perspective-taking) and emotion processing.  
**Nitty-gritty** - We find greater similarity in brain activity across more empathic subjects. This similarity is seen in mentalizing & emotion processing brain regions.  
**My roles/techniques** - Conducting <a href="https://www.hassonlab.com/inter-subject-correlation">Inter-subject Correlation (ISC)</a>, <a href="https://naturalistic-data.org/content/Intersubject_RSA.html">Inter-Subject Representation-Similarity Analysis (IS-RSA)</a>, and sentiment analysis (NLTK, python).

## Representation of people in the brain and it's association with social connection (data collection ongoing)  
**Overview** - Does people's extent of social connection modulate self-other neural representation? Do loneliner folks have more distinct representation of themselves? Are certain folks more susceptible to negative social evaluation?  
**Nitty-gritty** - we also collect behavioral assays and blood samples (to test for biomarkers for extreme social disconnectedness/loneliness).  
**My roles/techniques** - designing experiment (python, psychopy), setting up fMRI protocol, recruiting/running subjects, preprocessing fMRI data (fmriprep), and more to come.

## Representation of oneself and one's romantic partner and it's association with relationship satisfaction (Undergraduate Honors Thesis, 2021)  
**Overview** - Do people's extent of social connection modulate self-other neural representation? Do loneliner folks have more distinct representation of themselves? Are certain folks more susceptible to negative social evaluation?  
**Nitty-gritty** - we also collect behavioral assays and blood samples (to test for biomarkers for extreme social disconnectedness/loneliness).  
**My roles/techniques** - SPM, MVPA using <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/tdtdecodingtoolbox/">The Decoding Toolbox</a> (Matlab), multi-level modeling (*R*), <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01650250444000405?journalCode=jbda">actor-partner interdependence modeling</a>.

## Are we blind to our inefficiency in cognitive mental operations (relative to perceptual operations), and is this driving our overconfidence in cognitive tasks? (Poster from Advanced Lab course, at Undergraduate Research Exposition, 2020)  
**Overview** - Do people's extent of social connection modulate self-other neural representation? Do loneliner folks have more distinct representation of themselves? Are certain folks more susceptible to negative social evaluation?  
**Nitty-gritty** - we also collect behavioral assays and blood samples (to test for biomarkers for extreme social disconnectedness/loneliness).  
**My roles/techniques** - designing experiment (matlab, psychtoolbox), recruiting/running subjects, numerous statistical analyses.

## Is visuo-proprioceptive integration different in Autism? (Summer research, 2019)  
**Overview** - Do people's extent of social connection modulate self-other neural representation? Do loneliner folks have more distinct representation of themselves? Are certain folks more susceptible to negative social evaluation?  
**Nitty-gritty** - we also collect behavioral assays and blood samples (to test for biomarkers for extreme social disconnectedness/loneliness).  
**My roles/techniques** - designing experiment (Unity, C#, VR Oculus Rift), piloting.
