## Cognitive processes underlying Collective Empathy (poster at Social & Affective Neuroscience Society, 2022)  
We find that empathic subjects engage brain regions involved in mentalizing (imagining the other person’s perspective/state of mind) and emotion processing. We find this using Inter-Subject Correlation (ISC): picking up only those brain signals that all (empathic) subjects seem to commonly/synchronously exhibit.
We also find some evidence for other cognitive processes at play. Individuals with similar empathy levels show similar brain activity in regions involved in fear processing. So, while mentalizing & emotion processing could aid empathy, you might be bounded in your ability to empathize by certain other cognitive processes too.

## Do people’s extent of social connection modulate self-other neural representation? (data collection ongoing)  
We hypothesize that if you are socially disconnected or lonely, your brain activity when thinking about yourself is very different from your brain activity when thinking about your friends. If you are very socially connected, your brain activity when thinking about yourself is very similar to your brain activity when thinking about your friends. Other cool stuff: we collect blood samples to test for biomarkers for loneliness, and also test for susceptibility to negative social evaluation.
