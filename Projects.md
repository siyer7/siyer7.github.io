## [Brain regions involved in remembering differently & positively](doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2306295121)  
Often, a friend might recall a difficult social experience more positively than yourself. What brain networks coordinate these differences? We find that right after the experience, these positive folks' brains exhibit very _distinct_ cross-talk (connectivity) within their default network -- 'default' referring to the fact this network's regions typically activate at rest by default. In contrast, the default network in folks with negative memories engage in a more _stereotyped_ fashion. We further show these effects are specific in time and brain space. This finding suggests that exploring _distinct_ thought spaces may be useful to hold positive memories of negative experiences.

## Representation of people in the brain and it's association with social connection (data collection ongoing)  
Does people's extent of social connection modulate self-other neural representation? Do loneliner folks have more distinct representations of themselves? Are certain folks more susceptible to negative social evaluation? To answer these questions, we are collecting fMRI data, behavioral data, blood samples (to test for loneliness biomarkers), and interview recordings.

## Neural Theory of Mind (ToM) and it's association with relationship satisfaction (Undergraduate Honors Thesis, 2021)  
Are people able to mentally represent their romantic partners' thoughts (this ability, roughly, is called Theory of Mind)? To do so, are they imagining themselves in their partners' shoes (Simulation), or following common-sense mental schemas (Theory-Theory)? [(read: ToM & simulation vs theory-theory)](http://embodiedknowledge.blogspot.com/2011/02/simulation-theory-vs-theory-theory.html) Does this have effects on their relationship? We found neural evidence for Theory of Mind in practice, but could not account for it using the Simulation hypothesis, and did not find an associated with relationship satisfaction.

## Overconfidence at cognitive tasks driven by ignorance? (Poster from Advanced Lab course, at Undergraduate Research Exposition, 2020)  
A replication of [Human noise blindness drives suboptimal cognitive inference, by Summerfield, C, et al., 2019 (Nature communications)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09330-7). For the same level of difficulty, we are less accurate but more (over)confident at cognitive tasks, relative to perceptual tasks, suggesting that we are blind to cognitive difficulty. This sheds further light on the nature of multidimensional human intelligence.

## Do people with autism differently integrate visual & proprioceptive inputs from Virtual Reality? (Summer research, 2019)  
People with Austism exhibit atypical multisensory integration, which may cause difficulties with sensorimotor behaviors. Here, we investigate their visuo-proprioceptive integration using a VR Headset, predicting overweighting of proprioceptive inputs.
