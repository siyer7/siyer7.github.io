## Cognitive processes underlying Collective Empathy (poster at Social & Affective Neuroscience Society, 2022)  
Overview - Empathic subjects are those who seem to collectively & synchronoulsy engage in mentalizing (perspective-taking) and emotion processing.  
Nitty-gritty - We find greater similarity in brain activity across more empathic subjects. This similarity is seen in mentalizing & emotion processing brain regions.  
My roles/techniques - Conducting Inter-subject Correlation (ISC)(link), Inter-Subject Representation-Similarity Analysis (IS-RSA)(link) from scratch, performing sentimental analysis using NLTK (python).  

## Representation of people in the brain and it's association with social connection (data collection ongoing)  
Overview - Do people's extent of social connection modulate self-other neural representation? Do loneliner folks have more distinct representation of themselves? Are certain folks more susceptible to negative social evaluation?  
Nitty-gritty - we also collect behavioral assays and blood samples (to test for biomarkers for extreme social disconnectedness/loneliness).  
My roles/techniques - designing experiment (python, psychopy), setting up fMRI protocol, recruiting/running subjects, preprocessing fMRI data (fmriprep), and more to come.
