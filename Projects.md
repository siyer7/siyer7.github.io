## Cognitive processes underlying Collective Empathy (poster at <a href="https://socialaffectiveneuro.org">Social Affective Neuroscience Society, 2022</a>)  
**Overview** - Empathic subjects are those who seem to collectively & synchronoulsy engage in mentalizing (perspective-taking) and emotion processing.  
**Nitty-gritty** - We find greater similarity in brain activity across more empathic subjects. This similarity is seen in mentalizing & emotion processing brain regions.  
**My roles/techniques** - Conducting Inter-subject Correlation (ISC)(link), Inter-Subject Representation-Similarity Analysis (IS-RSA)(link) from scratch, performing sentimental analysis using NLTK (python).

## Representation of people in the brain and it's association with social connection (data collection ongoing)  
**Overview** - Do people's extent of social connection modulate self-other neural representation? Do loneliner folks have more distinct representation of themselves? Are certain folks more susceptible to negative social evaluation?  
**Nitty-gritty** - we also collect behavioral assays and blood samples (to test for biomarkers for extreme social disconnectedness/loneliness).  
**My roles/techniques** - designing experiment (python, psychopy), setting up fMRI protocol, recruiting/running subjects, preprocessing fMRI data (fmriprep), and more to come.  

## Representation of oneself and one's romantic partner and it's association with relationship satisfaction (Undergraduate Honors Thesis, 2021)  
**Overview** - Do people's extent of social connection modulate self-other neural representation? Do loneliner folks have more distinct representation of themselves? Are certain folks more susceptible to negative social evaluation?

## Are we less equipped at cognitive mental operations, compared to perceptual ones? Our blindness to cognitive relative difficulty of Is Perception-Cognition misalignment causing overconfidence? (Poster from Advanced Lab course, at Undergraduate Research Exposition, 2020)  
**Overview** - Do people's extent of social connection modulate self-other neural representation? Do loneliner folks have more distinct representation of themselves? Are certain folks more susceptible to negative social evaluation?  
**Nitty-gritty** - we also collect behavioral assays and blood samples (to test for biomarkers for extreme social disconnectedness/loneliness).
