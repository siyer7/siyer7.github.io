## Brain regions & thought patterns involved in remembering differently & positively ([paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2306295121))  
Often, a friend might recall a difficult social experience more positively than yourself. What brain networks coordinate these differences? We find that right after the experience, these positive folks' brains exhibit very _distinct_ cross-talk (connectivity) within their default network -- 'default' referring to the fact this network's regions typically activate, by default, when we rest. In contrast, the default network in folks with negative memories engage in a more _stereotyped_ fashion. We further show these effects are specific in time and brain space. This finding suggests that exploring _distinct_ thought spaces may be useful to hold positive memories of negative experiences.

## How common our neural conceptualizations of popular figures are might reflect how socially connected we are ([paper](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/8m4tb))  
Similar brain activity tends to reflect similar cognitive processes. At the same time, similar thoughts, values, etc. tend to bind people together, while dissimilarity breeds disconnectedness. Here we find that dissimilar brain activity when thinking about popular figures reflects social disconnectedness, and vice versa.

## How do people with Autism combine different perceptual senses (vision & kinaesthetics)? (paper incoming)  
When you move your hand in front of you, you get information about its movement through vision as well as kinaesthetics (the sense of motion of your own body). People with autism, in some cases, have difficulty combining information through multiple sources. Here we show that when combining vision & kinaesthetics, people with and without autism perform _similar_ combinations: specifically, they both tend to distrust their visual sense. For example, if their eyes (vision) tell them their hands are moving upward ever so _slightly_, while their kinaesthetics tells them that their hand is stationary, people will tend to in fact believe that their hands are moving _slightly_ downwards, in the direction opposite to vision! We use Virtual Reality to test this.

## How clearly you conceptualize of your partner's thoughts in your brain does not reflect your relationship satisfaction (Undergraduate Honors Thesis; [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ns8i8w2RaADW3nm_YVQnqG3MIgnHVREG/view?usp=sharing))  
We find that people's brain activity shows specific patterns when thinking about others' (their partners') thoughts, an ability called [Theory of Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind), typically exercised by the [temporo-parietal junction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporoparietal_junction#:~:text=Theory%20of%20mind,-Theory%20of%20mind&text=Recent%20studies%20suggest%20that%20both,states%20of%20self%20and%20others.). While one would imagine that clearly thinking about one's partner's thoughts might support empathy, thoughtfulness, etc., we find no associated of this with the couples' relationship satisfaction.

## Unawareness of errors when noting what you saw are caused not by poor visual perception, but by poor combination of multiple visual cues. ([paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jOr3APRANkCdkK8yipAX8hQSRBJugI18/view?usp=sharing)); [poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kt2NTJqlA8VAAGdZ8CnLlgxnGuXFlgvf/view?usp=sharing))  
A replication of [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09330-7). We are blind to our errors when we combine visual information from different locations. This sheds light on the fact that errors occur not initally at the time of perception, but later at the time of combination & computation.
