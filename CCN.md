## A cognitive neuroscience student's journey of understanding computation

If your only foray into neuroscience is cognitive, then you may not understand papers coming from its sister field of computation. You may not understand what a 'model' means, or why a model seems to be proposed every other day, or how someone could find tuning parameters as fun as 'understanding cognition, emotions, decision making'. You are not alone (and I sincerely hope I wasn't alone). My aim here is to tell the story of how I came to appreciate these terms and what they represent, as opposed to simply telling you the facts. For what it's worth, I think that's how a lot of teaching should be done - motivating a discovery or theory as opposed to listing it down.


As a lab manager/research assistant (a full-time job typically 2-3 years between one's undergrad and PhD in the U.S., with an aim to get exposure and know if PhD is for you), I was surrounded by cutting edge cognitive neuroscience research - a study of primarily human neuropsychological processes studied popularly using 1) brain imaging techniques like fMRI & fNIRS, and/or 2) electrophysiology tools like EEG, and 3) behavioral analyses. My experience was mostly with fMRI and behavior, and so I'll talk about those from now. The kind of questions we would probe were 'what brain area underlies this behavior', 'how do people behave under different contexts and emotions and with different people', 'how do brain regions interact to characterize a behavior', 'how can we frame vague terms like aggression and cooperation in terms of decision making, learning, and memory', etc. Traditionally, the answers are more descriptive than quantitative - for e.g., 'regions interact more when engaging in a multifaceted task' - without quanitifiable predictions or takeaways of '_more_ engaging'. This has been changing though, as we move from merely discovering patterns to quanitfying and charactersizing them.
