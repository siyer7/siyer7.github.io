### Computational neuroscience:
Only beginning september 2023 did I start getting serious exposure and some understadning of this field. I would now claim to have pivoted to this field, but am very firmly a naive student yet, so take what I say with a pinch of salt (at least as of 2024). So what is it about? Well, it seems there are at least 2 big themes: 1 is to build understanding, build _circuit/systems_ models of how neurons interact with one another, carry and pass information, cause behaviors, etc. The other is to build understanding, build _behavioral_ models of the mind, how our decisions are made, carried out, influenced by things like the environment or emotions, etc. The key requirement, it seems (though I could be wrong), is the use of models, which are like recipes for how neurons interact or decisions unfold.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circuit models, which I am interested in at the moment, elucidate how neurons project information, from the time one sees a bouqet of flowers in the air to the time one moves the their hands to catch it; from the sensory cortex to the motor cortex. A lot of irrelevant information is filtered out, like the color of the flowers, as we make the decision to catch the bouquet. Concurrently a lot of previous, relevant information, like how to move one's hands, is filtered in. How do neurons filter such information? How do they encode the past, our memories? How does this encoding change with practice, these actions become habitual, if you religiously practise bouquet catching every morning?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike circuit models which have neurons for units, behavioral models have to content with more vague (some say more complicated) entities for units, like how 'values', 'reward sensitivity', 'risk aversion', 'routine preference', 'baseline emotionality', etc. comprise the decisions we make and the actions we take, wehther in health or sickness (the field of computational psychiatry looks at how these units get distorted or distort behaviors under mental dysfunction).  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I will note about this field that struck me, was the primary use of animals, mice and monkeys being the common culprits. Because of ease (physical and legal) of accessing neurons and genes, there is a lot more scientists can manipulate and test at the level of neurons and corresponding behavior. There are rare cases where we have similar access (and note I learnt this only this past month) to human brains, an example being epileptic patients who have electrodes implanted for treatment purposes. From these patients, scientists are allowed to record data from individual neurons using these electrodes, much like we can do with other species.  


### Cognitive neuroscience 1: fMRI
Ah, my comfort zone; what I have spent the most time practising. I got into fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) in my senior year of undergrad, and then worked full time on it for a couple years after. Essentially, it involves having human participants perform mental tasks as they lay still inside a brain scanner, while scientists track blood flow in the brain, which is a proxy for oxygen and energy usage by active neurons. This way, we can inspect which regions, en masse, activate and interact during different types of mental processes. I say 'en masse', because blood flow gives a very course spatial estimate: the smallest unit meaningfully detected by fMRI (called voxel, shorthand for volumetric pixel), measuring 3mm in length, comprises 1,000,000 neurons on average, each measuring 50$\mu$m in length on average.

If your only foray into neuroscience is cognitive, then you may not understand papers coming from its sister field of computation. You may not understand what a 'model' means, or why a model seems to be proposed every other day, or how someone could find tuning parameters as fun as 'understanding cognition, emotions, decision making'. You are not alone (well, I sincerely hope there is someone out there like me). My aim here is to tell the story of how I came to appreciate these terms and what they represent, as opposed to simply telling you the facts. For what it's worth, I think that's how a lot of teaching should be done - motivating a discovery or theory as opposed to listing it down.

As a lab manager/research assistant (a full-time job typically 2-3 years between one's undergrad and PhD in the U.S., with an aim to get exposure and know if PhD is for you), I was surrounded by cutting edge cognitive neuroscience research - a study of primarily human neuropsychological processes studied popularly using 1) brain imaging techniques like fMRI & fNIRS, and/or 2) electrophysiology tools like EEG, and 3) behavioral analyses. My experience was mostly with fMRI and behavior, and so I'll talk about those from now. The kind of questions we would probe were 'what brain area underlies this behavior', 'how do people behave under different contexts and emotions and with different people', 'how do brain regions interact to characterize a behavior', 'how can we frame vague terms like aggression and cooperation in terms of decision making, learning, and memory', etc. Traditionally, the answers are more descriptive than quantitative; for e.g., 'regions interact more when engaging in a multisensory task', or 'greater distinction in stimuli elicits greater neural response pattern separation', but without quanitifiable inferences or justifications of how much _more_ engagement or separation. This has been changing though, as we move from merely discovering patterns to characterizing them; yet the upper limit on quanitifability will be bounded by psychological theory and how much worldly statistics should reflect in neural data. In other words, how much should a difference of stimuli worth 5 units be reflected in neural pattern separation, and why? This lacking of laws,
