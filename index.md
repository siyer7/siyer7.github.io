Hi - yes, I have a serious dearth of good solo pictures!  
This site, which will probably be a forever work-in-progress, is an attempt to document my research, and more generally, my life beyond research. While the site was initially a career/research oriented project, I have strived to also make the personal component transparent and relatable, noting my failures, struggles, and learnings, both in and out of lab. I hope you enjoy and feel free to reach out.
